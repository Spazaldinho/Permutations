Test 1:
    Terminal:
    Please enter the string for which you would like to find all possible permutations.
        Please note that this will program will remove all non-alphabetical characters, and 
        will only take up to 10 characters: abc
        ['ABC', 'ACB', 'BAC', 'BCA', 'CAB', 'CBA']     
        There are 6 permutations of the characters ABC.
    Explanation:
        This test case uses the example given in the assignment, string "abc". It verfies that
        the string is capitalized.

Test 2:
    Terminal:
        Please enter the string for which you would like to find all possible permutations.
        Please note that this will program will remove all non-alphabetical characters, and 
        will only take up to 10 characters: cba
        ['ABC', 'ACB', 'BAC', 'BCA', 'CAB', 'CBA']
        There are 6 permutations of the characters ABC.
    Explanation:
        Similar to the first test, this one verifies that the example form the assignment is
        calculated correctly. However, in this case the input is unsorted. This case helps
        make sure that the quick sort algorithm is working correctly.

Test: 3
    Terminal:
        Please enter the string for which you would like to find all possible permutations. 
        Please note that this will program will remove all non-alphabetical characters, and 
        will only take up to 10 characters: aaccbb
        ['ABC', 'ACB', 'BAC', 'BCA', 'CAB', 'CBA']     
        There are 6 permutations of the characters ABC.
    Explanation:
        This test case expects the same results as the previous two tests. This input verifies
        that the program is able to remove duplicate letters, and also sort the string.

Test 4:
    Terminal:
        Please enter the string for which you would like to find all possible permutations. 
        Please note that this will program will remove all non-alphabetical characters, and 
        will only take up to 10 characters:a&% bc4 324 $%
        ['ABC', 'ACB', 'BAC', 'BCA', 'CAB', 'CBA']     
        There are 6 permutations of the characters ABC.
    Explanation:
        This test case expects the same results as the previous tests, but also includes
        special characters, whitespaces, and digits to verify that the program is able to
        correctly remove all non alphabetical characters:
